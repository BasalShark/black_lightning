I'm not going to describe everything you need to do, but things to remember:

1. Make a database.yml file
2. Comment out "config/use_dynamic_shortcuts" in config/initializers/rolify.rb 
3a. Run "rake db:setup" ...if you want sample data
3b. Run "rake db:schema:load" ... if you don't
4. Uncomment "config/use_dynamic_shortcuts" in config/initializers/rolify.rb 
5. Marvel at your personal Bedlam website
