== PROJECT BLACK LIGHTNING

This aim of this project is to build a new website for Bedlam Theatre. But not just that! It is to build a stable platform upon which new heights can be reached.

The initial stage of the project is to build a public facing frontend accompanied by a member-facing (producer/committee) administration system.
