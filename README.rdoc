Welcome to the BlackLightning Documentation.

Please run <tt>rake doc:app</tt> to ensure that what you are seeing is consistent with what is written in the code files.

You could also run the annotate gem (not in gemfile) to update the database schema information included in the
documentation (you will need to re-run <tt>rake doc:app</tt> after).

Within the documentation lies useful information. Use it as you will.

Please make an effort to keep it up to date.
