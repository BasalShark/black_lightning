# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We have a policy of only ever supporting the latest published version. Using older versions is unsupported
but deployments are fairly simple!

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| others  | :x:                |
