This is because of the way ActiveStorage's blobs work.

Run the following command in the rails console and make sure it returns exactly one result:
> ActiveStorage::Blob.where(filename: 'default-<filename>.<extension>')

If it does not return one result, there is a duplicate blob and you have to carefully check which ones you need to delete.

If it does, you can run:
> blob = ActiveStorage::Blob.find_by(filename: 'active_storage_default-<filename>.<extension>)

You first have to delete all related attachments. You can do this by running:
> attachments = ActiveStorage::Attachment.where(blob_id: blob)
> attachments.delete_all

Then you can delete the blob:
> blob.delete

As long as you update the new default url on the model, it should be fine and it will load the new default image automatically.

Please note that the default_image_blob in the active_storage_helper looks for defaults with the assets/images/defaults (aka the current folder) as its root.
