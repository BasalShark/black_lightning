Markdown
========

Most text entered into the Bedlam Admin site will be rendered using markdown.

Markdown is an increadibly powerful, yet very natrual markup language.

---------------------------------------------------------

Paragraphs
----------

Starting a new paragraph is easy. Simply create two newlines.

    This is some text.
    
    This is a new paragraph.

However, one of the few oddities of Markdown is that a single newline will not have any effect.

Fear not! You can force Markdown to create a newline by putting two spaces before the newline:

    This is some text.  
    This is on a newline.

Links
-----

Markdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.  
Details about reference links can be found on the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link)

Inline links can be created as follows:

    [This](http://xtspro.com/+/eutc/) is EUTC's XTSPro page.

If you're referring to a page that is on the Bedlam Website, you can use
relative paths:

    See the [About](/about/) page for details.

Headers
-------

Headers can be created by 'underlining' the text with dashes or equals signs.
