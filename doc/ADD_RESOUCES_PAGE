= Adding Resources / About / Get Involved pages

While content in the above sections can be edited using the admin interface,
it is not possible to create a new page.

Instead, you should create a new file called <tt>mypage.html.erb</tt> under one of the
following directories:

* <tt>app/views/about</tt>
* <tt>app/views/get_involved</tt>
* <tt>app/views/admin/resources</tt> (and subdirectories)

The file is just a normal HTML file, with embedded Ruby.

In order to allow the content to be editable in the admin interface, add the following
code to the page.

  <%= display_block("Get Involved - Act", false) %>

The first parameter to EditableBlockHelper#display_block is the block name.
The second parameter tells the site whether the block is used in admin pages or
not, so should be true for resources. It exists primarily to ensure that
attachments to that block can't be accessed without authentication.

== About and Get Involved Pages

For the about and get involved pages, adding a file to one of the above directories
will automagically create links in the correct layout.

If necessary, you can configure the name of the link given to a page in the relevant
controller by adding an entry to the alias hash.

  @alias = {
    'ssw' => 'Stage, Set and Wardrobe',
    ...
  }

== Resources

For the resources pages, any subdirectories are automagically linked (e.g. any
resources in <tt>app/views/admin/resources/tech</tt> have links created automagically in
the sidebar). For "top level" resources (i.e. those in the resources directory
itself) a link will need to be created in the dashboard.

The dashboard widget is defined in <tt>app/views/admin/dashboard/_resources_widget.html.erb</tt>
